# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Foundation

Initial Rust implementation of the Temnion architecture's first milestones.

### Implemented

- Model-agnostic shard, source, epoch, entity and event identifiers.
- Separate valid, observation and known-time clock domains.
- Dense, bounded live state with generation-safe handles and slot reuse.
- Typed, append-only in-memory history with atomic batch admission.
- Entity and temporal filters, known-as-of cutoffs, scan/result budgets and
  snapshot-pinned in-process pagination.
- `tem help`, `tem version`, `tem describe` and a runnable `tem demo`.
- State/history examples and seeded A/B/D reference workloads.
- The supplied architecture originals, licensing documents and implementation
  roadmap.

### Scope

This is a **volatile foundation**, not a production database release. There is
no durable acknowledgment, WAL, TSF persistence, replay engine, combined
state/history transaction, daemon, TemQL parser, TNP transport, MCP server,
EKS or Studio yet. The benchmark runner is an initial reference harness, not
evidence that the full architecture's performance gates have passed.

Future work is tracked in the repository's milestone issues and
[`docs\ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).
